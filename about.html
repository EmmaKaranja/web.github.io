        I am a Capricorn born on 1st January. I was baptized a Catholic at 4 months old but later converted to a Presbyterian when I was 10 years of age. My hobbies include singing, swimming, cycling and playing badminton. After finishing high school, I joined Kenya Medical Training College to pursue a course on Environmental Health Science/ Public Health. I got my driverâ€™s license when I was 21 years. Finally, I am a proud aunt to 2 adorable kids (nephew and niece).
