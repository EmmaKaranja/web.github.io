      <h2 id="history"> HISTORY OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB </h2>
      <p>
        The first internet activity dates to 29th October 1969 through the Interface Message Processor (IMPs). It was referred to as ARPAnet named after the US Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. They developed the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to run the following applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/telnet_1"target="_blank">Telnet</a> to connect a local terminal to remote computers.</li>
        <li>File Transfer <a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/ftp"target="_blank">(FTP)</a> for moving files between computers.</li>
        <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol <a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/smtp"target="_blank">(SMTP)</a> for E-mail/ exchanging messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other notable milestones:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethernet, an example of Local Area Network (LAN) was developed in 1973.</li>
        <li>Mosaic, a user-friendly web browser made it possible for millions of users to access the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s (Kefer and Baiget, 2001).</li>
      </ul>

    <div id = "section-3">
      <h2 id="components">WEB ARCHITECTURE MAIN COMPONENTS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Presentation layer:</li>
        <p>
          It is accessible to user through the browser and consists of the User Interface (UI) components that support interaction with the system. It is developed using:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong>: The code that determines what the website will contain.<br>
          <strong>CSS</strong>: Determines how the website will look.<br>
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>: Make the website interactive by responding to a user’s actions.
        </p>
        <li>Business layer:</li>
        <p>
          It is also known as the Business Logic/ Domain Logic/ Application Layer. It accepts user requests from the browser, processes them, and determines the routes through which the data will be accessed.
        </p>
        <li>Persistence layer:</li>
        <p>
          It is also known as storage/ data access layer. It is closely connected to the business layer, so the logic knows which database to talk to and the data retrieving process is more enhanced (Alexsoft n.d.).
        </p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id = "section-4">
      <h2 id="importance">IMPORTANCE OF WEB ARCHITECTURE</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>	Helps to understand the needs of the users and provide them with answers.</li>
        <li>	Saves time for the users.</li>
        <li>	Makes updating and maintenance work simplified.</li>
        <li>	Makes websites look more aesthetic.</li>
        <li>	Reduces overall cost since the maintenance cost will also be less (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id = "section-5">
      <h2 id="delivery">WEB PAGE DELIVERY</h2>
      <p>
        For a web page content information to be presented to the user, the following are required for the system:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Retriever engine:</li>
        <p>
          Transmits a domain to a server(parser) and the server sends the information needed back to the retriever.
        </p>
        <li>Parser engine:</li>
        <p>
          Analyses the HTML source code of a web page and determines whether to display information.
        </p>
        <li>Display engine:</li>
        <p>
          Displays the approved information from the Parser (Pennell et al., 2006).
        </p>
      </ol>
      <h3>Step by step explanation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>First the device must be connected to a router to make sure the message arrives at the right destination.</li>
        <li>Next, a modem is needed to connect to a network.</li>
        <li>	Next the network is connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) so that the message is carried from the original network to the destination network.</li>
        <li>Type the web address/ Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the address bar of the browser.</li>
        <p>
          By default, most of the URLs start with the protocol identifier/scheme; HTTP and HTTPS for forms/logins to prevent information from being intercepted but other protocols include: mailto (for mail client) and ftp (file transfer).<br>
          www.gooogle.com is an example of a domain name/host and has a unique IP address assigned to it but not user friendly so the Domain Name System (DNS) finds the proper IP address of the intended domain name.<br>
          Next bit is the path to the file e.g., /US/docs/Learn.<br>
          Another component is, The Query String; Sometimes the following example can be displayed: ‘?key1=value1&key2=value2’. These are extra parameters provided to the Web server and are a list of key/value pairs separated with the & symbol. Thus, displaying more options.<br>
          A fragment identifier/ anchor may also be present in the URL and starts with the symbol ‘#’ to indicate somewhere in the document/ subsection. It is never sent to the server with the request.<br>
          The scheme and host components are not case-sensitive, but the path and query string are case-sensitive. Typically, the whole URL is specified in lowercase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The scheme is followed by a colon and two forward slashes.<br>
          The path name begins with a single forward slash.<br>
          If a query string is specified, it is preceded by a question mark (IBM 2014).</em>
